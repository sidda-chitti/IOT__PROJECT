ABSTRACT:


By using IOT technology and Arduino software the Automatic Street Light Control system is designed. 
It automatically switches ON/OFF lights based on the sunlight brightness level and it reduces the manual work. 
In this a sensor called Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) is used  which senses the light like our eyes.


BASIC PRINCIPLE:

The automatic streetlight control system operates on 12v DC supply.
The automatic streetlight controller has a photoconductive device whose resistance changes proportional to the
extent of illumination, which switched ON/OFF the LEd with the use of transistor as a switch.

The LDR is used to convert light energy to electrical energy.


COMPONENTS:

LDR sensor
resistor
LED
USB CABLE
connecting wires
Arduino UNO



steps:

step -1: Insert first transistor Q1-BC547 (NPN) on PCB board shown in the circuit diagram
step -2: Connect another transistor Q2-BC547 (NPN) on PCB board shown in the circuit	diagram.
step -3: Connect wires across emitter pin of both transistor and negative terminal of battery on the PCB board.
srep -4: Connect a wire across collector pin of transistor Q1 and base pin of transistor Q2.
step -5: Connect a resistor 1k across positive terminal of battery on the PCB board and collector pin transistor Q1.
step -6: Connect LDR (Light Dependent	Resistor) across positive terminal of the battery and base terminal of transistor Q1
step -7: Insert a transistor 330 ohm across base pin of transistor Q1 and negative terminal of battery
